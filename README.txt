Question 1:
- Use gradient descent to learn the weights of a linear regression model via minimization of the least-squares loss function
	- In other words, take the least-squares loss function and apply gradient descent to it to find the optimal weights
	- Initialize all weights to zero
	- Mini-batch size of 1
- As data, use the pumadyn32nm dataset
	- Use only the first 1000 data points on the training set to predict on the test set
- Predict on the test set and then present the test RMSE

Question 1 Requirements:
- Present the final test RMSE
Question 2 Requirements:
